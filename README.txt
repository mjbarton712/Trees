This project exhibits the creation of 3D trees using stochastic L Systems (procedural generation). 

Each tree is created using a string, with different characters performing different actions, such as drawing a cylinder, rotating, branching off, etc. 

All code is original code to this project. 

See the trees for yourself!:

Once the blue backgroudn appears, press space to generate a tree, and then explore the other options.
